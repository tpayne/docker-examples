Docker Examples
===============
The examples contained in this repo run on various flavours of Linux. The examples are driven by a set of simple makefiles.

To run the examples simply do the following

	% cd samples; make 
  
This will build all the examples.

To clean up, simply repeat with the clean target

	% cd samples; make clean
  
The examples will run various Dockerfiles building containers for `Centos`, `OpenSuse` and `Busybox`.

More examples will be added at a later date.
