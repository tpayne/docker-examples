Notes:
- Differences between CMD, ENTRYPOINT, RUN 
-- CMD is a default command executed when a container is run, but can be overriden by the docker run command
-- ENTRYPOINT is the command executed when a container is run. It cannot be overriden
-- RUN is used in the construction of a container to add new layers
