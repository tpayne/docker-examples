Notes:
- Differences between CMD, ENTRYPOINT, RUN? 
-- CMD is a default command executed when a container is run, but can be overriden by the docker run command
-- ENTRYPOINT is the command executed when a container is run. It cannot be overriden
-- RUN is used in the construction of a container to add new layers
- Using POD or DEPLOYMENT YML?
-- Use DEPLOYMENT YML as it allows deployment pods to be restarted if they fail. Direct Pod deployments (Kind: Pod) will not be restarted
